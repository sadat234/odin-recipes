    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven</p>
   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Cornmeal for baking sheet</li>
        <li>Flour for surface</li>
        <li>1 lb. pizza dough (thawed, if frozen)</li>
        <li>3/4 c. marinara sauce</li>
        <li>3 oz. mozzarella cheese, coarsely grated</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. grated parmesan</li>
        <li>Basil, for sprinkling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>If you have one, place a pizza stone in the oven and heat oven to 500ºF (if you can’t heat oven this high without broiling, set to 475ºF). Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal.</li> </br>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, shape pizza dough into a 14- to 16-in oval or circle and place on prepared sheet (make sure that the dough slides easily around the sheet, if not, add a bit more cornmeal).</li> </br>
        <li>Spread sauce on dough, leaving a ½-in boarder all the way around and sprinkle with mozzarella and then Parmesan. If using a stone, slide the pizza off the sheet onto the stone. Bake until crust is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with basil just before serving, if desired.</li> 
    </ol>
