I'm on a project to create a simple yet meaningful website using the basics of HTML.
By the end of my project, I should be familiar with some HTML basic elements.
I should be able to create a website containing a few webpages. 
I will be making use of the link elements to connect to other pages on my website.
I will also add some cool images to make my website look cool. 
Let's roll!!
